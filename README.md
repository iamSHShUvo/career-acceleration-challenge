# Career Acceleration Challenge

## Purpose

This repository documents my work during the **Career Acceleration Challenge**, a structured and execution-driven program focused on building strong fundamentals and industry-ready development skills.

This is not a casual practice repository. It is a public record of disciplined daily execution, code quality, and consistency under continuous evaluation.

---

## Overview

* **Duration:** 120 Days
* **Mode:** Daily tasks, frequent assessments, and strict review

The challenge is designed to develop professional habits from day one by assuming zero shortcuts and emphasizing manual coding, clarity, and correctness.

---

## Focus Areas

Over the course of the challenge, this repository will reflect work related to:

* Python fundamentals and intermediate concepts
* Problem solving and logical thinking
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Backend and application development
* Introduction to machine learning workflows
* Production-oriented project development

Progress is demonstrated through code, structure, and commit history rather than progress tables or logs.

---

## Working Principles

* All code is written manually without copy-pasting
* Tasks are submitted in clearly organized, chronological folders
* Emphasis is placed on readability, naming, and structure
* Commits reflect completed outcomes, not intentions

---

## Status

Active and in progress.
